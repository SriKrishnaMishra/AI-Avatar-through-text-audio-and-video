# 🎥 AI Avatar through Text, Audio, and Video

A Jupyter Notebook-based project that demonstrates how to generate AI-driven avatars and lip-synchronized videos from text and audio sources. This repository includes example notebooks for converting images to video, creating lip-synced animations, and more.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses AI techniques to **animate avatars using text, audio, and video**. It aims to take text inputs, generate corresponding voice and visual outputs, and produce synchronized talking avatar videos — useful for AI presenter systems, animated characters, virtual assistants, etc.

---

## 🚀 Features

✔️ Generate animated video from images and audio using AI
✔️ Lip-sync animation using video input
✔️ Text-to-speech and audio animation support
✔️ Jupyter Notebook workflows for experimentation

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

This type of project typically involves:

* **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** – Convert text to realistic voice audio (e.g., via gTTS, ElevenLabs, etc.)
* **Lip Sync Animation** – Align avatar facial movements with audio (many open-source tools support this)
* **AI Avatar Video Generation** – Create talking avatars or animated video output from text and audio ([GitHub][1])

*These exact components aren’t included automatically by GitHub — you may need to integrate libraries or APIs depending on your implementation.*

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash                                                                                                        
   git clone https://github.com/SriKrishnaMishra/AI-Avatar-through-text-audio-and-video.git
   ```

2. **Open Notebooks in Colab or Jupyter**

   * `Image_to_video.ipynb`
   * `Video_AI_Lip_Sync.ipynb`          

3. **Install dependencies**
   Use Colab, or install locally:

   ```bash                
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Create a suitable `requirements.txt` with relevant libraries: e.g., OpenCV, TTS, animation libs.)*

4. **Run each notebook step-by-step**
   Follow markdown comments and code cells to understand the workflow.

---

## 🧩 How It Works (Typical Flow)

1. **Input text or image**
2. **Convert text to speech** (TTS)
3. **Generate audio output**
4. **Animate avatar with lip sync**
5. **Export video**

Note: Specific code for voice synthesis and lip sync animation may need customization or additional tools depending on your model choices.

---

## 📌 Tips & Enhancements

💡 Add a `requirements.txt` file with all dependencies for reproducibility
💡 Add detailed comments in notebooks explaining each step
💡 Include sample output videos or images to show what the project produces
💡 Link to research or libraries used (e.g., SadTalker for lip-sync) ([GitHub][1])

## 📄 License                                          

Add a license (e.g., MIT) to make distribution and reuse easier.

---

## 🙌 Acknowledgments                    

Thanks for exploring AI-based avatar animation! If you need help integrating TTS libraries or advanced lip sync techniques, I can help with that too 😊
